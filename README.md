# Blasius and Thermal Boundary Layer Solver MATLAB
This repository contains a MATLAB implementation for solving a coupled boundary layer problem, consisting of:
1- Blasius equation for the hydrodynamic boundary layer
2- Energy equation for the thermal boundary layer
Both equations are solved numerically using MATLABâ€™s built-in bvp4c solver.
